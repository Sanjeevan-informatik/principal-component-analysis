What is PCA?

Principal Component Analysis, or PCA, is a statistical method used to reduce the number of variables in a dataset. It does so by lumping highly correlated variables together. Naturally, this comes at the expense of accuracy. However, if you have 50 variables and realize that 40 of them are highly correlated, you will gladly trade a little accuracy for simplicity.

you can go through the notebook to understand the covariance, eigenvalue, eigenvector and understand the importance of selecting the high spread  axis of the principal components
